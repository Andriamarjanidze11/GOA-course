      <p><h3>Penguins are a group of aquatic flightless birds from the family Spheniscidae<br> of the order Sphenisciformes.[4] They live almost exclusively in <br>the Southern Hemisphere: only one species, the Galápagos penguin, is found<br> north of the Equator. Highly adapted for life in the<br> ocean water, penguins have countershaded dark and white plumage and flippers for swimming.<br> Most penguins feed on krill, fish, squid and other forms<br> of sea life which they catch with their bills and swallow whole while swimming.<br> A penguin has a spiny tongue and powerful jaws to grip slippery prey</h3></p>

      <h3>They spend about half of their lives on land and the other half in the sea.<br> The largest living species is the emperor penguin (Aptenodytes forsteri): <br>on average, adults are about 1.1 m (3 ft 7 in) tall and weigh 35 kg (77 lb).<br> The smallest penguin species is the little blue penguin <br>(Eudyptula minor), also known as the fairy penguin, which stands around 30–33 cm (12–13 in)<br> tall and weighs 1.2–1.3 kg.[7] Today, larger penguins generally <br>inhabit colder regions, and smaller penguins inhabit regions with temperate or tropical climates.<br> Some prehistoric penguin species were enormous: as tall or heavy as an adult human. There was a great diversity of species <br>in subantarctic regions, and at least one giant species in a region around 2,000 km south of the equator 35 mya,<br> during the Late Eocene, a climate decidedly warmer than today.</h3>
