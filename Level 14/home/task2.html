 <h4><i>Python is a high-level, general-purpose programming language.<br> Its design philosophy emphasizes code readability with the use of<br> significant indentation.
Python is dynamically typed and<br>garbage-collected. It supports multiple programming paradigms,<br> including structured (particularly procedural),<br> object-oriented and functional programming. It is often described as a "batteries included"<br> language due to its comprehensive standard library.<i></h4>

       <h4> <i>JavaScript is a high-level programming language that follows the ECMAScript standard. <br>It was originally designed as a scripting language for websites but became <br>widely adopted as a general-purpose programming language,<br> and is currently the most popular programming language in use.<br> JavaScript is usually found running in a web browser <br>as interactive or automated content, ranging from popup messages and live clocks<br> to large web applications.<br> JavaScript is also commonly used in server-side programming through platforms like Node.js,<br> or "embedded" in non-JavaScript <br>applications where the base programming language lacks the high-level functionality that JavaScript offers.</i></h4>
